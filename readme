Algorithm implementation:
gibbs.m implements LDA GibbsSampling
Experiment:
1. Predefined topics are generated by gentopic.m.
2. Use drchrnd.m to sample a topic distribution for one document and given this topic distribution,wordsampling.m generates one 100 words for the doc. docsubset.png shows a subset of documents generated in this way.
3. imagegibbs.m is a script that perform 4 runs of LDA GibbsSampling Algorithm over the self-generated corpus and visualize the learning topics.
4. run_#.png shows result of learning topics from self-generated corpus; loglikelihood.png shows log likelihood log(p(w|z)) of the 4 runs.
